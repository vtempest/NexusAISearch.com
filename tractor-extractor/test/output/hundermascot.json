Thunder shares mascot duties with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_(mascot)\">Miles</a>, a human who wears a horse head mask atop a Broncos uniform. </p><p>Three purebred <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_horse\">Arabians</a> have held this role since 1993, all <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(horse)\">gray horses</a> whose coats lightened with age until they turned completely white. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Magness_Blake\">Sharon Magness-Blake</a> has owned all of them, and Ann Judge has been their rider since 1998 and trainer since 1999. As of 2022<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thunder_(mascot)&amp;action=edit\">[update]</a>, Thunder has appeared in four <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl\">Super Bowls</a>. The original Thunder performed in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXII\">Super Bowl XXXII</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXIII\">Super Bowl XXXIII</a>; Thunder III appeared in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLVIII\">Super Bowl XLVIII</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_50\">Super Bowl 50</a>. Thunder III also made appearances in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Square\">Times Square</a> and on television morning news shows in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City\">New York City</a> as part of the pre-game promotion for Super Bowl XLVIII. </p><p>Thunder's duties as mascot typically include leading the team onto the field at the start of every <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_(sports)\">home game</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canter\">galloping</a> down the length of the field whenever the team scores a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown\">touchdown</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(American_and_Canadian_football)\">field goal</a>. Thunder and his rider also interact with fans before the game; the horse is particularly popular with children, who are allowed to pet him. The horses who have served as Thunder need to remain calm in situations that would normally frighten most horses, such as being in football stadiums with thousands of cheering fans, exploding <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrotechnics\">pyrotechnics</a>, cheerleaders waving <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pom-pom\">pom-poms</a>, and other spectacles common to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League\">National Football League</a> (NFL) games. He routinely appears in parades, makes hospital and school visits, and attends various other public functions. He has been flown on airplanes, ridden in elevators, and appeared indoors at press conferences and banquets.</p><p>The original Thunder, later named \"Thunder Sr.\", was described as bold and courageous. He was a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stallion\">stallion</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breed_registry\">registered</a> as JB Kobask, a former <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_show\">show horse</a>, who was team mascot for the Broncos from 1993 until his retirement in 2004. He continued making community appearances until his death in 2009. Thunder Sr. was succeeded in 2004 by \"Thunder II\", an Arabian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelding\">gelding</a> registered as Winter Solstyce. He had been the personal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasure_riding\">pleasure riding</a> horse of Magness-Blake. Judge described him as being somewhat timid when he first began his role as mascot but eventually grew into it. He retired from mascot duties in early 2014 but appeared in the 2016 Super Bowl 50 victory parade in downtown <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver,_Colorado\">Denver</a> following the Broncos win over the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Panthers\">Carolina Panthers</a>. \"Thunder III\", a gelding registered as Me N Myshadow, was the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understudy\">understudy</a> to Thunder II, and trained specifically for mascot duties beginning at age three when he was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_training\">started under saddle</a>. He began performing at preseason games in 2013. Although Thunder II was still active as team mascot during the 2013–14 season, Thunder III was sent to Super Bowl XLVIII because he was younger and better able to handle air travel. He is described as laid-back, preferring to doze off during games when not performing. Thunder III ran one last time during the 2020 season. Thunder IV, registered as Phantom JD, is the current mascot and began making appearances in the 2021 season.</p><h2>History</h2><figure>Video clip of Thunder III (Me N Myshadow) making a run in 2014 after <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning\">Peyton Manning</a>'s record-breaking 509th touchdown pass</figure><p>The original \"Thunder\", JB Kobask, was loaned to the Denver Broncos by Sharon Magness-Blake of Magness Arabians after she received a phone call from team officials asking if she had a \"white\" horse.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_(mascot)#cite_note-NWork-1\">[1]</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_(mascot)#cite_note-Parkinson-2\">[2]</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_(mascot)#cite_note-4\">[a]</a> Thunder's debut as team mascot was on September 12, 1993, during the Broncos' victory over the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Chargers\">San Diego Chargers</a>.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_(mascot)#cite_note-Pomeroy-5\">[4]</a> Angela Moore, his rider at the time,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_(mascot)#cite_note-CSU-6\">[5]</a> galloped him down the field after each Broncos touchdown.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_(mascot)#cite_note-Pomeroy-5\">[4]</a> Thunder's mascot duties were expanded to include delivering the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_(ball)#American_and_Canadian_football\">game ball</a> to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(American_football)\">referees</a> at the start of each home game. Spectators were allowed to interact with Thunder and pet him prior to the game.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_(mascot)#cite_note-Parkinson-2\">[2]</a> Magness said, \"Thunder is friendly, and Broncos fans think it's good luck for the opposing team to pet our mascot\".<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_(mascot)#cite_note-Fuoco-7\">[6]</a> He was particularly popular with children,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_(mascot)#cite_note-Pomeroy-5\">[4]</a> appeared on T-shirts, and was referred to as the \"second most popular Bronco\" after former quarterback <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Elway\">John Elway</a>. Thunder appeared at Elway's 1999 retirement gala.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_(mascot)#cite_note-Parkinson-2\">[2]</a> When team uniforms were <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos#2012–present\">redesigned in 1997</a>, Thunder was the inspiration to incorporate a horse-head profile as part of the logo on the team's helmets.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_(mascot)#cite_note-Pomeroy-5\">[4]</a> During a February 4, 1997 press conference introducing the new logo, the team president and the art director for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.\">Nike</a>, creators of the new design, described it as \"a powerful horse with a fiery eye and mane.\"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_(mascot)#cite_note-8\">[7]</a></p><p>The original Thunder, also known as Thunder Sr., was retired in 2004 after serving 11 years as the team mascot.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_(mascot)#cite_note-Parkinson-2\">[2]</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_(mascot)#cite_note-9news-9\">[8]</a> Magness-Blake replaced him with Thunder II,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_(mascot)#cite_note-Parkinson-2\">[2]</a> a 1994 Arabian gelding registered as Winter Solstyce.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_(mascot)#cite_note-AHA-10\">[9]</a> He was Magness-Blake's personal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasure_riding\">pleasure riding</a> horse prior to taking on his new role as team mascot.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_(mascot)#cite_note-Holden-11\">[10]</a> As Thunder II grew older, Magness-Blake anticipated the need for a replacement and added a third gray horse to the team. He became known as Thunder III, a 2000 Arabian gelding registered as Me N Myshadow. Thunder III initially served as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understudy\">understudy</a> for Thunder II,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_(mascot)#cite_note-AHA-10\">[9]</a> and was trained specifically for the role of team mascot from his start under saddle.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_(mascot)#cite_note-Jaffer-12\">[11]</a></p><h2>Mascot duties</h2><figure><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DenverBroncosentrance.JPG\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/DenverBroncosentrance.JPG/220px-DenverBroncosentrance.JPG\" /></a>The tunnel from which Thunder emerges when he leads the Broncos onto the field is shaped like the Broncos' horsehead logo, and outside are cheerleaders, pyrotechnics and crowd noise.</figure><figure><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Thunder_(horse_mascot).JPG\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Thunder_%28horse_mascot%29.JPG/220px-Thunder_%28horse_mascot%29.JPG\" /></a>Thunder III and Ann Judge delivering the game ball</figure><p>Thunder leads the team onto the field at the beginning of each home game,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_(mascot)#cite_note-Preble-13\">[12]</a> and typically gallops from one end of the field to the other whenever the team makes a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown\">touchdown</a>.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_(mascot)#cite_note-Kids-14\">[13]</a> He may also make a run after a field goal, but not a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football#Scoring\">safety</a>.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_(mascot)#cite_note-espngallery17-15\">[14]</a> Each time he makes a run, a four-person crew runs down the sidelines to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone\">end zone</a> to escort Thunder back to his sideline position.

Thunder stopped immediately, averting a potentially dangerous situation.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_(mascot)#cite_note-Preble-13\">[12]</a> Another unexpected event occurred in 2014 during Super Bowl XLVIII when the pyrotechnics display was supposed to have been executed before Thunder led the team out but it went off unexpectedly during his run. Thunder responded to the situation with aplomb, continuing to run forward onto the field, though he performed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_(leg)#Flying_change\">flying lead changes</a> with each explosion.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_(mascot)#cite_note-Oakes-20\">[19]</a></p><p>Thunder's record number of runs may have been during a 52–20 win on September 29, 2013, when he crossed the field eight times.
