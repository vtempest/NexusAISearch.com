As Mark and I went through each category, we agreed to two minor swaps: my Tuesday dog walk for his Saturday one, and having me clean the kitchen counters and him take over the bathtub.</p><p>The latest version of &#x201C;Mark and Mandy&#x2019;s Relationship Contract,&#x201D; a four-page, single-spaced document that we sign and date, will last for exactly 12 months, after which we have the option to revise and renew it, as we&#x2019;ve done twice before. The contract spells out everything from sex to chores to finances to our expectations for the future. And I love it.</p><p>Writing a relationship contract may sound calculating or unromantic, but every relationship is contractual; we&#x2019;re just making the terms more explicit. It reminds us that love isn&#x2019;t something that happens to us &#x2014; it&#x2019;s something we&#x2019;re making together. After all, this approach brought us together in the first place.</p><p>Two and a half years ago, I wrote a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/fashion/modern-love-to-fall-in-love-with-anyone-do-this.html\">Modern Love column</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/fashion/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html\">36 questions</a></p><p>In the past, expecting a relationship to work simply because the people involved loved each other had failed me. I spent my 20s with a man who knew exactly what he wanted and how he wanted to be. All I had wanted was for him to love me.</p><p>Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
